This is an old C++ project I found from my time in high school. After thoroughly reading the code, I still cannot understand what is happening. 

Here is what ChatGPT has to say about the program:

The code is simulating a dice game where the objective is to roll at least one "5" with a set of dice. The game starts with 5 dice and rolls the remaining dice each turn until a 5 is rolled, at which point the rolled 5 is added back to the set of dice and the process repeats. The game ends either when all 5 dice are rolled as 5s or the player has rolled the dice 3 times without rolling a 5. The main function runs the game multiple times and keeping track of the number of wins, number of tries, and win percentage. The program is also calculating the average win percentage over multiple runs of the simulation.


Anyways, feel free to check it out.
